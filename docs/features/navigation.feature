Feature: Navigate the File tree with the keyboard

  Scenario: Leave editor movement to Helix while Grove is unfocused
    Given a Workspace containing entries
      | kind | path       | lines |
      | file | active.txt | 100   |
      | file | other.txt  | 100   |
    And "active.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And the editor receives "j" while Grove is unfocused
    Then the editor cursor is on line 2
    When Grove is focused
    And Grove receives "Enter"
    Then Helix shows the "active.txt" document

  Scenario Outline: Refuse Workspace-root actions and reveal the Cursor
    Given a Workspace containing entries
      | kind | path            | count |
      | file | item-{:02d}.txt | 40    |
    And an Active file outside the Workspace
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And the terminal height becomes 8 rows
    And Grove is focused
    Then "Workspace root" has Cursor
    When the Wheel scrolls down 20 times over Grove
    Then the File tree does not show "item-00.txt"
    When Grove receives "<key>"
    Then the editor still shows the outside file
    And the File tree shows "item-00.txt"
    And "Workspace root" has Cursor
    When Grove receives "Down"
    And Grove receives "Enter"
    Then Helix shows the "item-00.txt" document

    Examples:
      | key   |
      | Enter |
      | Left  |
      | Right |
      | r     |

      | target.txt |
    And "anchor.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove ready for an Active file change to "target.txt"
    And Grove is focused
    Then "anchor.txt" has Cursor
    When Helix changes the Active file to "target.txt"
    Then Helix shows the "target.txt" document
    When Grove receives "Enter"
    Then Helix shows the "anchor.txt" document

  Scenario: Reach a Helix chord after releasing Grove
    Given a Workspace containing entries
      | path       |
      | anchor.txt |
      | target.txt |

      | anchor.txt |
    And "anchor.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And Grove is focused
    And Grove receives "<key>"
    Then Helix receives the modified key
    And "anchor.txt" has no Cursor mark

    Examples:
      | key    |
      | Ctrl-n |
      | Ctrl-r |
      | Ctrl-d |

    And Grove is focused
    And Grove receives "<key>"
    And Grove receives "<key>"
    Then Helix shows the "anchor.txt" document
    When Grove receives "Enter"
    Then Helix shows the "target.txt" document

    Examples:
      | key  |
      | Down |

    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And the terminal height becomes <height> rows
    And Grove is focused
    And Grove receives "PageDown"
    Then Helix shows the "anchor.txt" document
    When Grove receives "Enter"
