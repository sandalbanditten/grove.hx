Feature: Follow Helix's current Workspace

  Scenario: Replace the Workspace and rebuild its File tree
    Given a Workspace named "first" containing entries
      | path    |
      | old.txt |
    And "old.txt" is Active in Workspace "first"
    And a Workspace named "second" containing entries
      | kind | path             | count |
      | file | aaa-scanned.txt  |       |
      | file | entry-{:04d}.txt | 8000  |
    When Helix starts with Grove in Workspace "first"
    And Helix runs "cd" for Workspace "second"
    Then the File tree root is "second"
    And the File tree shows "aaa-scanned.txt"
    But the File tree does not show "old.txt"

  Scenario: Scope Git status to the current Workspace
    Given a Workspace named "first" containing entries
      | path       |
      | shared.txt |
    And "shared.txt" is Active in Workspace "first"
    And Git tracks "shared.txt" as modified in Workspace "first"
    And a Workspace named "second" containing entries
      | path       |
      | shared.txt |
    And Git tracks "shared.txt" as clean in Workspace "second"
    When Helix starts with Grove in Workspace "first"
    Then "shared.txt" carries a modified Git mark
    When Helix runs "cd" for Workspace "second"
    Then the File tree root is "second"
    And "shared.txt" uses the theme text foreground

  Scenario: Replace the Workspace with push-directory and return with pop-directory
    Given a Workspace named "first" containing entries
      | path    |
      | old.txt |
    And "old.txt" is Active in Workspace "first"
    And a Workspace named "second" containing entries
      | path    |
      | new.txt |
    When Helix starts with Grove in Workspace "first"
    And Helix runs "push-directory" for Workspace "second"
    Then the File tree root is "second"
    And the File tree shows "new.txt"
    But the File tree does not show "old.txt"
    When Helix runs "pop-directory" for Workspace "first"
    Then the File tree root is "first"
    And the File tree shows "old.txt"
    But the File tree does not show "new.txt"

  Scenario: Start a fresh File tree session after returning
    Given a Workspace named "first" containing entries
      | kind      | path                    | count |
      | file      | anchor.txt              |       |
      | directory | expanded-dir            |       |
      | file      | expanded-dir/inside.txt |       |
      | file      | tail-{:02d}.txt          | 40    |
    And "anchor.txt" is Active in Workspace "first"
    And a Workspace named "second" containing entries
      | path    |
      | new.txt |
    When Helix starts with Grove in Workspace "first"
    And the "expanded-dir" directory is expanded
    And the terminal height becomes 8 rows
    And the Wheel scrolls down 20 times over Grove
    Then the File tree ends with "tail-39.txt"
    When Helix runs "cd" for Workspace "second"
    Then the File tree root is "second"
    When Helix runs "cd" for Workspace "first"
    Then "expanded-dir" remains collapsed
    And Pane row 2 is "expanded-dir"
