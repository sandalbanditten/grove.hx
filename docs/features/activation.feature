    And "outer/inner/active.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove ready for an Active file change to "other/later.txt"
    Then the File tree shows "outer/inner/active.txt"
    And "outer/inner/active.txt" has no Cursor mark
    When Helix changes the Active file to "other/later.txt"

    And "anchor.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And Grove is focused
    And Grove receives "Up"
    And Grove receives "<key>"
    Then "folder" has Cursor
    When Grove receives "Down"
    And Grove receives "<key>"
    Then Helix shows the "folder/inside.txt" document

    Examples:
      | key   |

  Scenario: Preserve the editor view when activating an open file
    Given a Workspace containing entries
      | kind | path       | lines |
      | file | active.txt | 100   |
      | file | other.txt  | 100   |
    And "active.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And the editor cursor moves to line 60 in "active.txt" with line 55 first
    And "active.txt" is activated
    And "other.txt" is activated
    Then Helix shows the "other.txt" document
    When "active.txt" is activated

  Scenario: Preserve the editor view when activating the Active file
    Given a Workspace containing entries
      | kind | path       | lines |
      | file | active.txt | 100   |
      | file | other.txt  | 100   |
    And "active.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And the editor cursor moves to line 60 in "active.txt" with line 55 first
    And Grove is focused
    And Grove receives "Enter"
    Then the editor view for "active.txt" is restored at line 60 with line 55 first

  Scenario: Preserve the exact path of a sanitized filename
    Given a Workspace containing entries
      | kind | path          |
      | file | anchor.txt    |
      | file | odd\nname.txt |
    And "anchor.txt" is Active
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    Then the File tree shows "odd\nname.txt"
    When "odd\nname.txt" is activated
    And the editor inserts "opened-" and saves
    Then the content of "odd\nname.txt" starts with "opened-"

  Scenario: Leave an open failure to Helix

      | file | anchor.txt |
      | file | locked.txt |
    And "anchor.txt" is Active
    And "locked.txt" is unreadable
    When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
    And "locked.txt" is activated
    Then Helix shows the "anchor.txt" document

  Rule: With representative links

    Background:
      Given a Workspace containing entries
        | kind        | path        | target    |
        | file        | file2.txt   |           |
        | file link   | file-link   | file2.txt |
        | broken link | broken-link | missing   |
      And "file2.txt" is Active

    Scenario: Ignore activation of a Broken link
      When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
      And "broken-link" is activated
      Then Helix shows the "file2.txt" document
      When the editor receives "i" while Grove is unfocused
      Then the active Editor view is in Insert mode

    Scenario: Open a File link
      When Helix starts with Grove in that Workspace
      And "file-link" is activated
      Then Helix shows the "file-link" document
